If you've not had any acquaintance with the mentioned concepts, don't panic. Fortunately, there are a bunch of really good resources in this area throughout the internet. Additionally, there are some useful links at the end of this section where you can easily find what you need to acquire a comprehensive understanding of this module.\n","\n","#### **What makes Newton-Raphson Method necessary to learn?**\n","* In short, Newton-Raphson Method enables us to extrapolate a function to find the solution without evaluating it at each possible point. As far as Machine Learning and Data Science are concerned, this sort of approach can be life-saving. Sometimes our data is produced by a supercomputer or our data is multi-dimensional with maybe thousands of dimensions, so it is not possible to evaluate each of our data points and then sort them, and find the maxima or minima.  The purpose of the emergence of Newton-Raphson method in these areas is to allow us to find the desired solution by evaluating the function at a limited number of data points.<br><br>\n","\n","#### **How to apply this amazing method to a function?**\n","\n","\n","* Consider the function $f(x)= x^3-2x+2$ which $x$ is a number produced by a super computer. Imagine $f(x)$ as a cost function that we desire to become zero, and x as a parameter of a complicated function. We solve this problem analytically by evaluating the cost function for each value of x but it would be quite expensive and very time-consuming, instead, we can use Newton-Raphson method to hunt for solutions. Although I know it is a very inexact example and it can easily be solved by setting the function equal to 0 and then solving for x, I hope it gives you the right sort of flavor. <br><br>\n","\n","* Newton Raphson method provides the following function:\n","<br>\n","\n","$(0.1)$\n","$$ Newton_{-}Raphson:x_{i+1} = x_i - \\frac{f(x)}{f'(x)} $$\n","<br>\n","* Let's apply the method to our function:\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","$(0.2)$\n","\n","$$f(x)= x^3-2x+2$$\n","<br>\n","  $(0.3)$\n","$$f'(x)= 3x^2-2$$\n","<br>\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","* The first step is to make a smart guess. Considering $f(x)$, you can see the constant is positive (+2). As a result, our first guess must be some negative number, for instance (-2).\n","\n","* It is the time to apply the method:\n","<br>\n","\n","<center>\n","\n","| $i$ | $x$     | $f(x)$   | $$f'(x)$$ |\n","|---|-------|--------|---------|\n","| 0 | -2    | -2     | 10      |\n","| 1 | -1.8  | -0.23  | 7.7     |\n","| 2 | -1.77 | -0.005 | 7.4     |\n","| 3 | -1.76 | -0.000 | $finish$  |\n","\n","table: three iterations of applying Newton method\n","\n","</center>\n","<br>\n","\n","* As the table shows, after just three iterations, we have found that $x = -1.76$ is approximately the solution of this equation. This means we just evaluate $f(x)$ for three values of $x$. Now, we know when $x = -1.76$, the cost function is equal to zero.\n","\n","#### **Conclusion:**\n","* Acquiring a thorough understanding of Newton-Raphson method is crucial because it is the infrastructure of the next module which is called Gradient Descent. All we know about deep learning and neural networks are based on Gradient Descent. Next, as we promised before, you can find a simple implementation of what we learned here.\n","\n","**See you then...**\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"Iq4UNx9SY52B"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":22,"metadata":{"id":"WrWdjTCTDH7r","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":210},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1696944029332,"user_tz":-210,"elapsed":393,"user":{"displayName":"Farzad Yousefi","userId":"17223507942772645910"}},"outputId":"73b9ec7a-1c86-4d83-c813-815ebf32a42b"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["The desired solution to this problem is x = -1.769.\n"," \n"]},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["          X      f(x)     f'(x)\n","0 -2.000000 -2.000000  10.00000\n","1 -1.800000 -0.232000   7.72000\n","2 -1.769948 -0.004850   7.39815\n","3 -1.769293 -0.000002   7.39119"],"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-4e5d4d7e-9414-40a5-ab66-3edcbb1768d8\" class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>X</th>\n","      <th>f(x)</th>\n","      <th>f'(x)</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>-2.000000</td>\n","      <td>-2.000000</td>\n","      <td>10.00000</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>-1.800000</td>\n","      <td>-0.232000</td>\n","      <td>7.72000</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>-1.769948</td>\n","      <td>-0.004850</td>\n","      <td>7.39815</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>-1.769293</td>\n","      <td>-0.000002</td>\n","      <td>7.39119</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>\n","    <div class=\"colab-df-buttons\">\n","\n","  <div class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <button class=\"colab-df-convert\" onclick=\"convertToInteractive('df-4e5d4d7e-9414-40a5-ab66-3edcbb1768d8')\"\n","            title=\"Convert this dataframe to an interactive table.\"\n","            style=\"display:none;\">\n","\n","  <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" height=\"24px\" viewBox=\"0 -960 960 960\">\n","    <path d=\"M120-120v-720h720v720H120Zm60-500h600v-160H180v160Zm220 220h160v-160H400v160Zm0 220h160v-160H400v160ZM180-400h160v-160H180v160Zm440 0h160v-160H620v160ZM180-180h160v-160H180v160Zm440 0h160v-160H620v160Z\"/>\n","  </svg>\n","    </button>\n","\n","  <style>\n","    .colab-df-container {\n","      display:flex;\n","      gap: 12px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #E8F0FE;\n","      border: none;\n","      border-radius: 50%;\n","      cursor: pointer;\n","      display: none;\n","      fill: #1967D2;\n","      height: 32px;\n","      padding: 0 0 0 0;\n","      width: 32px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #E2EBFA;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 2px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.3), 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.15);\n","      fill: #174EA6;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-buttons div {\n","      margin-bottom: 4px;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #3B4455;\n","      fill: #D2E3FC;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #434B5C;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);\n","      filter: drop-shadow(0px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3));\n","      fill: #FFFFFF;\n","    }\n","  </style>\n","\n","    <script>\n","      const buttonEl =\n","        document.querySelector('#df-4e5d4d7e-9414-40a5-ab66-3edcbb1768d8 button.colab-df-convert');\n","      buttonEl.style.display =\n","        google.colab.kernel.accessAllowed ?
