# **The Most Tricky But Essential Mathematical Concepts Which Play Crucial Role In Machine Learning Algorithms.**

This repository contains several educational purpose notebooks in which some of the most tricky but essential mathematical concepts which play crucial role in machine learning algorithems, including **Taylor Series**, **Constrained** **Optimization**, **Newton-Raphson Method**, and **Gradient Descent**, are explained and programmed.

## **Requirements**
We do not need many things to get started with. As you can see, all the materials are built in the form of .ipynb(python notebooks), so we will have three oprions to be able to study the materials:
  1. **Github:**
   It is possible to study the files just by clicking on in the current page. However, you cannot change the codes and run the cells. In the other words, they are availabe just read-only here.

  2. **Google colaboratory:** Another option is to use the google online service called Google Colaboratory, only by clicking on the botten below. It is possible to run and apply changes to the cells.<br> [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12v347FZdJ-jbrPxP2cGQhD_UeMa91IfX/view?usp=sharing)

  3. **Jupyter Notebook**(*not recommended*):
  The last option that we might have is to open these notebooks with your local installed Jupyter notebook that I personally do not recommed.

## **Purpuse**
I personally believe that it is not enough to deal with tricky and complicated problems. The final purpose of everyone should be to share what they learned so that others can make significant progress faster and achieve greater things which can even change the world. It does not matter who finally changes the world to a better place. We all are living in the same world, so we will eventually take advantage of the changes.
